## Packer Templates for Ubuntu with ZFS Root

This repository contains [Packer][packerio] templates for building Amazon Machine Images for Ubuntu with a ZFS root filesystem. Currently the following distributions are supported:

- Ubuntu 20.04 ("Focal") LTS with AWS-Optimized Kernel
- Ubuntu 18.04 ("Bionic") LTS with AWS-Optimized Kernel
- Ubuntu 16.04 ("Xenial") LTS with AWS-Optimized Kernel

The template is easily modified for Debian and other recent Ubuntu distributions, however.

You can read about how this template works on the [operator-error.com][oe] blog. Some relevant posts:

- [Building ZFS Root Ubuntu AMIs with Packer][oepost1]
- [Ubuntu 18.04 with Root ZFS on AWS][oepost2]

## Running a build

Use the `bionic`, `xenial` or `focal` targets of the Makefile in root of the repository to build an AMI in `us-west-2`, and copy it to all regions. Use a recent version of Packer - only the latest available at the time of last editing has been tested (currently: version 1.3.1).

The following environment variables must be set in order for the build to succeed:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
